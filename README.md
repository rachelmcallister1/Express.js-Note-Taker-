# Express.js-Note-Taker-

## Overview

I created a Note Taker application, by connecting the front and back end code and deploying the application to Heroku. This app can be used to write and save notes. 
This application uses the Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.
Additionally, this application can delete notes from the JSON file by reading the notes that are in the ds.json file under the db and Develop folder. Notes with a given 'id' can be removed.
